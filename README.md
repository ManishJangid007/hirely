## üöÄ Production Deployment with PM2

This guide covers deploying the application using PM2 on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Prerequisites for Production
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- PM2 (will be installed globally)

### Step 1: Build the Application

First, create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

### Step 2: Install PM2

Install PM2 globally on your system:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

### Step 3: Install Serve Package

Install the serve package for serving static files:

```bash
npm install serve
```

### Step 4: Deploy with PM2

#### Option A: Quick Start (All Platforms)

```bash
# Start the application
pm2 start "npx serve -s build -l 3000" --name "hirely-interview-app"

# Save PM2 configuration
pm2 save

# Set PM2 to start on system boot
pm2 startup
```

#### Option B: Using Ecosystem File (Recommended)

The project includes an `ecosystem.config.js` file. Use it for more control:

```bash
# Start using ecosystem file
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Save configuration
pm2 save

# Set PM2 to start on system boot
pm2 startup
```

### PM2 Management Commands

#### Basic Commands
```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs hirely-interview-app

# Restart application
pm2 restart hirely-interview-app

# Stop application
pm2 stop hirely-interview-app

# Start application
pm2 start hirely-interview-app

# Delete application from PM2
pm2 delete hirely-interview-app
```

#### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Monitor CPU/Memory usage
pm2 monit

# View detailed information
pm2 show hirely-interview-app

# List all processes
pm2 list
```

#### Deployment Updates
```bash
# After making code changes:
npm run build
pm2 reload hirely-interview-app

# Or restart completely:
pm2 restart hirely-interview-app
```

### Environment Configuration

#### Custom Port
To run on a different port (e.g., 8080):

```bash
# Using ecosystem file
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --env production

# Or directly
pm2 start "npx serve -s build -l 8080" --name "hirely-interview-app"
```

#### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**:
   ```bash
   # Find process using port 3000
   lsof -i :3000
   
   # Kill the process
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **PM2 not starting on boot**:
   ```bash
   # Re-run startup command
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

3. **Permission issues (Linux/macOS)**:
   ```bash
   # Fix npm global permissions
   sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
   sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
   ```

4. **Build errors**:
   ```bash
   # Clear npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Reinstall dependencies
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

#### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# View real-time logs
pm2 logs hirely-interview-app --lines 100

# View error logs only
pm2 logs hirely-interview-app --err

# View output logs only
pm2 logs hirely-interview-app --out
```

### Security Considerations

1. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Only open necessary ports (3000 for the app)
   - Use reverse proxy (nginx) for production

2. **HTTPS Setup** (for production):
   ```bash
   # Install nginx and configure SSL
   sudo apt install nginx
   # Configure nginx to proxy to localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Environment Security**:
   - Keep Node.js updated
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use strong passwords for any admin interfaces

### Performance Optimization

1. **Memory Management**:
   ```bash
   # Set memory limit
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js --max-memory-restart 1G
   ```

2. **Load Balancing** (for high traffic):
   ```bash
   # Start multiple instances
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js -i 4
   ```

3. **Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Install PM2 Plus for advanced monitoring
   pm2 install pm2-server-monit
   ```

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)
